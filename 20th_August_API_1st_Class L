to talk with different system, whatever u want to do. 
there are some function to check this validity of user, fn will give a return 
so, api is being used to communicate to hatoroginious or homoginious system to 
work.
any single app is dependet 

#we will use flask
# jango willnot b used in this course# jaango is required for web developer
but just for data science flask is the best

we hv to download postman , we will write code in pycharm and access this code in
postman. postman is a tool which has been used to test an api

download postman

#to create a function which will take to input and it will give its summation
# i dont want to execute
'''
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify   #import flask and install pip install Flask
#flask library or class help to expose ur code to the outer world
def test(a,b):
    return a+b
app =Flask(__name__)  #this is obj of flask class to use all the thngs of flask class 

# i dont want to print this function from here, i want to execute in another website or
# another site like postman . in this situation i need to connect this and another
#
#print(test(4,5))

#lets creat onemore fn
@app.route('/abc', methods = ['GET', 'POST'])
#@app , here i am calling obj. route is fn which has deifindeed to create woute for this 

#here route('/abc') is the link of my computer to access it 
#get means we are sending a data by url or browser, where everyone can see my data,
#post means we are sending a data by body where it cant visible in url 

def test1():
    if (request.method=='method'):
        a=request.json['num1']  #requesting to send data in json format and num1 that data people will send
        b=request.json['num2']
        result= a+b
        return jsonify((str(result))) 
 
#instantiate
#
if__name__=='__main__':
    app.run()

    
#__name__=='__main__ it will call all the classes in python
#error 400 indicates server is error ur url is not working
#post error
